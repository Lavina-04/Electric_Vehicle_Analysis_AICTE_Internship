# Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) over time using a real-world dataset obtained from Kaggle.
The analysis includes cleaning the dataset, processing the fields, visualizing EV trends, and identifying how EV usage is growing across counties and years.

# Objectives

To clean and preprocess a real-world electric vehicle dataset.

To perform exploratory data analysis on EV adoption.

To visualize year-wise EV population trends.

To understand the relationship between EVs and overall vehicle population.

# Key Insights

EV adoption shows a consistent upward trend, especially in recent years.

Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid EVs (PHEVs) contribute significantly to total EV growth.

The increase in EV population suggests rising awareness, better infrastructure, and growing demand for cleaner transportation.

# Conclusion

This project helped in understanding how to clean real datasets, visualize meaningful patterns, and interpret EV growth trends.
The insights gained can support future forecasting and policy decision-making related to electric vehicle adoption
