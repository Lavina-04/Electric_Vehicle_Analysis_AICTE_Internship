## Electric Vehicle Population Analysis — Week 2

# Objective

This week focuses on advanced analysis of Electric Vehicle (EV) data to uncover patterns, correlations, and growth trends over time.
The aim is to identify top EV-adopting counties, compare EV types, and understand key numeric relationships.

# Key Insights

Top 10 Counties: Identified the regions with the highest EV adoption.

BEV vs PHEV Comparison: Compared total counts of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).

Correlation Analysis: Found positive relationships between EV totals and total vehicle registrations.

Growth Trend: Visualized EV population growth over time, showing a consistent upward trajectory.

Tools & Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Google Colab

Dataset: Electric Vehicle Population Size History by County (Kaggle)

# Improvisations Done

I cleaned and standardized the dataset to fix formatting issues, converted text-based numbers to numeric values, and added advanced visualizations including a yearly growth trend chart and correlation heatmap.
This improved clarity, made the data more insightful, and enhanced the overall project presentation.
